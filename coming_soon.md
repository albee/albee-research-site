***I will be joining the faculty at the University of Southern California in Fall 2025! The Laboratory for Autonomous Systems in Exploration and Robotics (LASER) will continue to pursue exciting research in these areas. Motivated students with a background in robotics, aerospace/mechanical engineering, computer science, and related fields are encouraged to apply for Ph.D. or research-based SM positions. Please indicate your interest on your application materials to USC Viterbi or email me directly at kalbee@usc.edu***
