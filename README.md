# albee-research-site

This is a Jekyll-based static site for my research work!

## Details

- Hosting service: GitHub pages
- Domain service: whatever github provides internally for *.github.io domains

## Usage

For serving content on localhost during development:

```bash
cd docs
bundle exec jekyll serve

# navigate to http://localhost:4000
```

For github pages deployment, see `.github/workflows/jekyll.yml`

## Notes

For anyone happening on this page, I highly recommend [this blog post](https://geekdude.github.io/tech/new-website/) for resources on
how to work with Jekyll/Github Pages.
