It all started in 2017 when Kristina and Keenan won their college senior design competition together, with Kristina discovering that Keenan was both an excellent business ***and*** life partner. Emboldened, Kristina ventured outside Keenan's East Campus dorm late one night, luring Keenan outside with
the promise of looking through a telescope on a remarkably clear New York City night. Then Kristina ran off to Singapore
to work on satellites while they both started the ultimate long distance relationship (by measure of both great circle distance and time zones).
Keenan eventually convinced Kristina that Boston was a great place to live in the winter and they both enjoyed the joys of graduate school and qualifying exams
and---perhaps more so---the nearby White Mountains in New Hampshire. Saying goodbye to many wonderful friends on the east coast, they uprooted
for San Francisco, followed by Los Angeles for Kristina to take her turn learning about rockets and taking ***more*** qualifying exams. They now happily roam
around Los Angeles, often by bike, and can be found by turns on top of a nearby mountain or checking out every Art Deco building in Los Angeles County on Keenan's very detailed and very necessary map.
