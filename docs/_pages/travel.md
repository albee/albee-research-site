### Getting to San Francisco

The Bay Area has three major airports: San Francisco (SFO), Oakland (OAK), and San Jose (SJC). We recommend flying into **SFO**, which connects directly to downtown via BART, the Bay Area's metro system. Both SFO and OAK are convenient by car---SJC is a longer drive.

San Francisco has excellent public transportation (and check out the historic cable cars!). Google Maps will show you all major routes. Uber/Lyft/Waymo (robots!) are also available. Parking in downtown San Francisco can be tricky, so plan ahead if driving! 

### Where to Stay

Downtown San Francisco is convenient to public transit and both venues. **We have reserved a hotel block at the Marriott Marquis San Francisco at a discounted rate, available through April 27th, 2024.** Link [here](https://book.passkey.com/e/50806307). There are also many alternative hotel and Airbnb options nearby. Downtown Berkeley is another good option with BART access, and is closer to the wedding venue on Sunday. 

### Friends and Family Reunion (Mission Creek Park Pavilion)

Mission Creek Park is very close to downtown San Francisco; we recommend public transit. Uber's headquarters is three blocks away, so naturally the city is crawling with rideshares. Alternatively, street parking is available nearby.

**Transit Directions:** 

- From the Market St. and 3rd Bart Stop, walk to Union Square/Market St Station Southbound.
- Ride the tram 3 stops.
- Exit at 4th St & King St.
- Walk across the bridge to Mission Creek Park

### Wedding and Reception (Piedmont Community Hall)

Piedmont is across the bridge, near Berkeley and Oakland, about a 20 minute drive or rideshare. 30 spaces are available in the Piedmont Community Hall parking lot. Additional street parking is also available. There is also a single transfer transit option, though car is a better bet.
